Working Paper 1: The Dual Effect of Music Energy on Advertising Effectiveness: Enhancing Viewership but Hindering Conversion
======
* With Liujie Qian, Jia Gai and Hongju Liu
Abstract:This study explores the relationship between background music and advertising effectiveness. Specifically, we concentrate on how the energy level of background music
influences the viewing completion and conversion rates of an advertisement. Using a comprehensive dataset from a leading short-video platform, we examine how differing energy
levels in background music impact viewer engagement and purchasing behavior. Interestingly, our findings disclose a paradox: high-energy music significantly elevates completion rates but
simultaneously reduces conversion rates. Through a combination of heterogeneity analysis and randomized experiments, we identify attention and distraction as the primary mechanisms
driving this phenomenon. Consumers exposed to high-energy music are distracted from the product by the background music, leading to increased viewership but decreased conversion
rates. This research offers novel insights into advertisement design, highlighting the intricate balance between viewer retention and conversion in high-energy advertisements. Moreover, it
provides practical guidance for marketers seeking to optimize ad performance.

Working Paper 2: The Shared-album Effect: How joint versus solo consumption impacts photo-taking and photo-sharing
======
* With Jia Gai, Congjiao Jiang and Hongju Liu
Abstract: Taking photos to document one’s experiences and share them with others has become integral to customers’ lives. This research investigates how consumption contexts (i.e., joint consumption versus solo consumption) influences the number of photos customers take. All five studies reveal a shared-album effect wherein customers in joint consumption take and share fewer photos than in solo consumption. We also find that transactive memories underlie the shared-album effect. In solo consumption, customers take photos using their smartphones to offload memories; thus, they regard their smartphones as agents for transactive memories. In joint consumption, however, customers regard their companions as independent agents for transactive memories who are more important than smartphones. This decreases their motivation to take photos to preserve memories. Furthermore, we document that the closeness of the relationship impacts photo numbers in joint consumption, wherein more closely bonded pairs rely more on their companion to offload memories and subsequently take fewer photos than less closely bonded pairs. The findings demonstrate the robustness of the shared-album effect across multiple experiences (i.e., dining at restaurants, staying in hotels, going on real or virtual field trips, and viewing an art exhibition) and across different empirical settings (i.e., secondary data, field experiment, online experiment). We also conduct a photo quality analysis and report an insignificant difference between joint and solo consumption. As viewers regard reviews with more photos as more helpful, our findings provide practical insights for businesses seeking to understand customers’ photo-sharing behavior on their review platforms.
