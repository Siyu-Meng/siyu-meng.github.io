Welcome to my website!

I am a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Guanghua School of Management, Peking University(PKU). My advisor is Prof. Hongju Liu.

As a empirical modeler, I aim to employ both econometric and machine learning methods to address marketing-related issues. My research focuses on digital marketing and background music. 

Prior to joining GSM, I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Management from Wuhan University.
